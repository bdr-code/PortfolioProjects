# COVID-19 Data Exploration Project
This project explores COVID-19 data from January 2020 to November 2023. Basic to advanced SQL queries are executed to answer questions and look at trends over the course of COVID-19. After the data exploration is complete in SQL, the queries are used to create some data visualizations in Tableau. My data exploration in SQL can be viewed [here](https://github.com/bdr-code/PortfolioProjects/blob/main/PortfolioProject.sql) and my dashboard in Tableau [here](https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/md.abdur.rob/viz/PortfolioProject_16902999016690/Dashboard1).
This project was built using SQL Server Management Studio (SSMS).

# Task
The  project aims to explore 2020-2023 COVID-19 Data by asking and answering data exploration questions. 
I choose to look at insights for Bangladesh since I am a Bangladeshi citizen. I also explored data globally and regionally.
